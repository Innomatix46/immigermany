# Paystack Integration Documentation

## Overview
The Paystack payment integration has been successfully implemented in the application. This document provides instructions on how to configure and use Paystack for processing payments.

## What Was Implemented

1. **Paystack JavaScript SDK** - Added to index.html
2. **Paystack Payment Handler** - Full implementation in Payment.tsx
3. **Configuration** - Paystack public key placeholder added

## Configuration Steps

### 1. Get Your Paystack Public Key
1. Sign up or log in to your [Paystack Dashboard](https://dashboard.paystack.com/)
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ API Keys & Webhooks
3. Copy your Public Key (starts with `pk_test_` for test mode or `pk_live_` for live mode)

### 2. Update the Public Key
Replace the placeholder key in `components/Payment.tsx` (line 13):
```typescript
const PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY = process.env.PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY || 'pk_test_YOUR_ACTUAL_PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE';
```

### 3. Currency Configuration
The implementation currently uses EUR (Euro). To change to Nigerian Naira or other supported currencies:
- In `components/Payment.tsx` line 94, change `currency: 'EUR'` to `currency: 'NGN'`

## Features Implemented

1. **Secure Payment Modal** - Paystack's iframe opens for secure payment processing
2. **Multiple Payment Methods** - Supports cards, bank transfers, and mobile money
3. **Transaction Reference** - Unique reference generated for each transaction
4. **Metadata** - Service details and appointment information included in payment
5. **Success/Cancel Handling** - Proper callbacks for payment completion and cancellation

## Testing

1. Use Paystack test cards for testing:
   - Success: 4084 0840 8408 4081
   - Failed: 4084 0840 8408 4089
   - CVV: 408, Expiry: Any future date

2. Test the payment flow:
   - Select a service
   - Fill in appointment details
   - Choose Paystack as payment method
   - Complete the payment in the modal

## Production Checklist
